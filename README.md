# Stream.it
**About**

This is a lightweight SwiftUI app that allows you to stream video and audio from a file or URL of any kind. This misses out all of the trouble with ads, and the large app sizes of video streaming apps like YouTube. (Note: Doesn't Support Streaming From Unsecure Protocols, e.g. http, Use https)
